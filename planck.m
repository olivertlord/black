%% Function PLANCK for function 'nlinfit' %	This is required to run the script function tempcalc. %   The funcition is called as non-linear least sq solution finding.%   And thus the function altimately belongs to script %   calcplank.m%%  x is the value solved as Temperature%  l is matrix of wavelenths in [nm] in script it converts to [cm]%  unir is matrix of radiation intensity corresponding to wavelength%function unir = planck(x, l)l = l *1e-7; %convert to [cm]% F should converge to zerounir = (l.^-5 *3.7418E-12 *x(1)) ./(exp(1.4388 ./(l *x(2)) ) -1);%  when you assume the emmisivity to be one%unir = (l.^-5 *3.7418E-12 *1) ./(exp(1.4388 ./(l *x(2)) ) -1);
